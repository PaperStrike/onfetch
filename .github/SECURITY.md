# Security

Although a testing tool is unlikely to introduce security vulnerabilities into production code, the maintainers of `onfetch` take all security vulnerabilities in `onfetch` seriously.

## Reporting a bug

Report security bugs in `onfetch` by emailing [sliphua@outlook.com](mailto:sliphua@outlook.com).

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, maintainers will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported issue.

Report security bugs in dependencies to the person or team maintaining the dependency.
